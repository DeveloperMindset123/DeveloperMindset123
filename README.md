### About me: 
My name is Ayan Das and I am currently a rising senior (a rising junior in Computer Science due to being a transfer student), I have an interest towards all things related to technology/programming: whether it's ML/AI, Fullstack web/App development, cybersecurity, Cloud/Data Engineering/IT. I find deep fufilment in taking complex problems and breaking them down into simpler concepts, learning new things on a daily basis and wish to continue to pursue higher education upon obtaining undergraduate degree. In terms of hobbies, it includes (but not limited to) reading (technical and non-technical books: {mathematics, history, other non-fiction}), biking, bodybuilding, MMA, meditation, piano, art, music and occupying myself with meaningful activities that makes me lose track of time.
